// When two different memory locations are created with same name,
// and one shadows another, then it's variable shadowing.

// Variable shadowing happens when a local variable
// (usually inside a block or function)
// has the same name as a variable in an outer scope,
// and temporarily "hides" or shadows the outer variable in that block.

// The outer variable is still there, but you canâ€™t access it
// from within the block where the new variable shadows it.
